1
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:08,040
Hi I'm so excited to be here.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,480
I've never been to Strangeloop or a Papers
We Love and I'm a super paper nerd so this

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,820
is right down my alley.

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,890
Just a little bit about me.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,940
I do tweet a lot about space, Zeeshan, thank
you for calling me out on that.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,140
I'm pretty obsessed with space.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,930
Spaaaace!

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:39,449
I'm a hardware hacker, reverse engineer, systems administrator of my flavors of Unix-based and specialized

9
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:47,019
in storage clusters yadda, yadda, I'm an old
lady in programming terms so that means I've

10
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:50,809
worn a lot of hats workwise.

11
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:58,720
For the last two and a half years I've started
my own company, using Kickstarter, so I want

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,940
to thank all the backers, I've met some of
you here today so I always love meeting backers,

13
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,940
thank you.

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,460
If you haven't received your stuff yet, I'm
sorry.

15
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,520
[laughter]

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,460
I'm 36% of the way shipped, that's official
numbers.

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:20,930
And I knit my 300th scarf, well, my machine
knit my 300th scarf last week and yeah, I'm

18
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:28,320
in the backer number of 70s to 80s, in the
one-scarf backer tier, so if that's you, your

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,869
scarf is coming soon.

20
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:40,470
As a small aside about papers, my grandfather,
my French grandfather, my name is Fabienne

21
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,369
Serri�re, which is unpronounceable so I
go by FBZ.

22
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:57,270
He was an audio engineer amongst other things,
and one of my Uncles found out about a project

23
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,670
I was doing in the early 2000s when my uncle
was still around, and he said, oh, your grandfather

24
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,091
did a project like that and I said, oh, that's
interesting and he said, no, with the exact

25
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:16,530
same technology and I said that can't be possible,
I'm working on negative impedence on subwoofers

26
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:23,890
and he said, no, from the 1930s, and I said
I used the same paper, and it really freaked

27
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:32,459
me out and I think we're genetically programmed
to like certain scientific papers and I just

28
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,230
thought I would put that out there.

29
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:41,250
I don't know if that was true, because my
uncle had passed and my grandfather obviously

30
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:49,650
passed a while ago, so yeah, scientific papers
that are genetically in my DNA that I should

31
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,040
like is a very strange thing for me to think
about, so.

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:03,450
This talk should probably be called my illogical
obsession with ... But it's a little long

33
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,340
so I called it knittable seashells.

34
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:20,150
A friend of mine nerd sniped me into this
term called algorithmic beauty of sea Shells.

35
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,440
How many of you have actually opened this
book.

36
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,739
Oh, my goodness.

37
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,310
It's slightly out of print.

38
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,410
Thank you online booksellers of weirdness.

39
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:44,870
It was published in 1995and the reason my
friend suggested it to me was because seven

40
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:51,870
years ago, in 2010, I had hacked a KH930 knitting
machine to work with modern computers and

41
00:03:51,870 --> 00:04:01,750
I was trying to knit outputs that were a one-off,
so generative art that looked good in pixelized

42
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,880
environments.

43
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,540
We'll get back to this in a bit.

44
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,829
But this is one of the ones that I knit on
that early machine.

45
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,530
This is a wide wrap, so it's kind of like
these dimensions.

46
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,110
This is a product placement.

47
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,110
[laughter]

48
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,340
It's not this exact one.

49
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,940
These are the ones I currently make.

50
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,690
So I'm super into generative knit wear, specifically.

51
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:35,449
And I tried generating some stuff from the
book but I'm going to come back to this and

52
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:44,660
it turns out there's lots of pairs on generating
sea shell patterns, earlier than the book

53
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,669
was a paper published in 1992 by one of the
same authors, Hans mine Hart and could he

54
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:59,330
written by Deborah Fowler and I'm going to
butcher this supposedly Polish name?

55
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,850
They wrote a paper as part of SIGGRAPH, so
thank you for sponsoring today.

57
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:13,610
That's not a product placement, that just
happened to be part of the papers.

58
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,990
And in it, this is before the book came out.

59
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:26,340
There's an actual seashell on the left of
the images so they not only generate the forms

60
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,110
but they generate the patterns that are on
the seashell which is what I'm particularly

61
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,960
interested in.

62
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:42,180
One of the papers that they reference in that
paper is pretty old, specifically from 1969,

63
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,330
and I was a little weirded out to see that
it was a computer simulations of a molluskian

64
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:56,600
pigmentation pattern so I kind of got to researching,
so a friend of mine who is a professor which

65
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:05,940
I am not in academia, managed to get me the
paper and pretty much every seashell generative

66
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:13,830
seashell or generative animal pattern paper
or book that I found referenced this paper

67
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,460
so I thought it must be pretty important.

68
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,340
It's really early, let's see what this is
all about.

69
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,759
So it was written in 196968 and published
in 1969.

70
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:33,190
The main author is C H. wadding ton and he
was a developmental biologist, a geneticist,

71
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:42,430
and kind of, I think, coined the term of epigenetics,
which is really cool, that's really early.

72
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,860
And this is probably not what you looked at
the time.

73
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,660
This is him a bit younger.

74
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:54,760
He was at the University of Edinburgh, and
then so I read the paper and I thought, OK,

75
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,139
this is interesting, but then I found a blogpost
from some librarians at the University of

76
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:06,639
Edinburgh that had an intriguing image that
was not in the original paper and to me it

77
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:14,360
looked like it was plotted, and I was really
intrigued by that.

78
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,789
And what I found out is that there's an entire
archive at the University of Edinburgh just

79
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:28,660
for the notes for this paper in the '60s,
so I acquired those notes, and I'm going to

80
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,430
share some really cool stuff from them with
you today.

81
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:41,539
Furs of all, there's a letter in it, which
seems pretty -- very early, so it's in the

82
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:50,870
23rd of February, 1968, and it's from Dr.
field in the parentheses, department of computer

83
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:58,440
science, we want to look official, I'm very
excited that you're coming, we have now improved

84
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,789
the computer scanner so it is possible to
generate the sort of aspects you are interested

85
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:04,120
in more easily.

86
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,420
This involves both using an Elliot 4120 and
a PDP7 computer in tandem.

87
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,990
The problem now, which I think is still a
very modern problem, is to find enough time

88
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,460
to program either or both problems.

89
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,500
[laughter]

90
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,360
It's possible that you might find a suitably
inclined student for the summer vacation.

91
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,770
[laughter]

92
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,300
How times have not changed at all.

93
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,040
So within this, there was another letter.

94
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:40,141
This is all in archival notes that I retrieved
from the University of Edinburgh and they're

95
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:44,771
a creative commons license, so if any of you
would like this archive of notes later, let

96
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:48,790
me know and I'm happy to share it with you,
because I already paid the fee.

97
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:58,480
So in here is a letter presumably from Waddington,
one of the authors on the paper, saying I

98
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,790
don't know how to lay my hands on such a person
myself, a student programmer, but I have a

99
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:09,611
little money from which I could pay someone,
but if you could find someone, there are some

100
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:15,660
funds available to pay them for two or three
months during the summer in 1968, and then

101
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:22,260
inside there is a letter informing Mr. Russell
Cowe which is annoyingly close to Russell

102
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,690
Crowe, so it's very hard to Google him.

103
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:40,050
I'm very happy to appoint you the assistant
from the 17th of June to the 31st of August

104
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,500
1978 you will be paid a rate of �10 per
week.

105
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,890
That's a little low for the time.

106
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:57,000
So we're talking student wages, your precise
duties will be described to you by Professor

107
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Waddington.

108
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,750
I hope you are prepared to accept this appointment.

109
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,950
So it turns out that Russell Cowe is still
alive, so he's the coauthor on the paper and

110
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:13,520
he now has a DVD archival company that he
started in 2001 and he's on the BBC a lot

111
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,440
and he seems like a generally awesome person,
so that's pretty exciting.

112
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,850
In the paper, so this is in the paper, not
in the archival stuff that I retrieved, it

113
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:30,750
talks a little bit about their setup and when
they say an ICL4130, that's the same thing

114
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,160
as an Elliot.

115
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,870
So ICL was the parent company of that stuff.

116
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:46,330
Let me find where I was in my notes.

117
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:51,200
The Elliot -- oh, I'm not there yet.

118
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,970
So the code was written in Fortran, which
they talk about in the paper, as well.

119
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,690
And I was hoping I would find Fortran snippets
in this archival treasure trove.

120
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,890
Unfortunately I did not, so I'm sorry.

121
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:14,690
I did find some other stuff, so I found a
description from Russ Cowe who describes technically

122
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:25,030
how he programmed the program, and interestingly
he also talks about the intricacies of being

123
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:33,700
able to load the PCP7 which was just used
for the display, so PDP7 in connection with

124
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:41,100
the deck display and some of the stuff was
interactive and some was not.

125
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,780
So it's kind of cool that he goes through
and describes what all of the initiation variables

126
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:52,000
are and it turns out these are all similar
to the algorithmic beauty of seashells that

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,380
came out and so this is all really, really
early stuff.

128
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:09,640
On stopping the program, the message end of
program is typed on the PDF teletype and inside

129
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:16,400
the archival notes are these little snippets
which are ripped-off pages from a drum feed

130
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,810
which I assuming were hooked up to the PDP7
and these are the setup variables for the

131
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:30,690
various runs of the seashell pattern generation
that they were doing.

132
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:41,500
And they're also noted by hand in pencil on
the back of images of the deck 340CRT that

133
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,850
they used.

134
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,480
So this is a picture of the CRT and I think
-- this isn't in the paper at all, so this

135
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,550
-- this is like a pretest one and I'm guessing
it's not done being generated and those were

136
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,810
there are those gaps in it.

137
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,320
I'm guessing.

138
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,950
Just to give you a little bit of context,
an Elliot 4130, which was introduced in 1965,

139
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:15,420
the paper was written in 1968, the foreground
of that is an Elliot 4130, is all those machines

140
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,420
there.

141
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,700
That is a lot of machine.

142
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,740
There were less than 200 built.

143
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,330
They were not a super-famous manufacturer,
they were a British manufacturer, and then

144
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,980
they had a PDP7 just hooked up to their display.

145
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:39,711
This PDP7 is actually up and running in Seattle,
so if you want to get online on a PDP7 you

146
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,080
just have to go to the living computer museum
in Seattle.

147
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,170
I am not affiliated with them.

148
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,210
They're just awesome.

149
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,000
[laughter]

150
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,760
What's cool is that this DEC340 that they
had, which you can see is that circular-looking

151
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:07,120
display, which we heard about peripherally
in the last talk, was also programmed, so

152
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,180
it had its own, yeah, programming parameters,
just for the display, as well, so if you think

153
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:19,450
working today is difficult, just imagine going
back and getting paid �10 a week to generally

154
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,020
code everything from scratch, just completely
everything.

155
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,020
The whole world.

156
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,060
So this is just to put it in context, Ken
Thompson and Dennis Richie wrote the first

157
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:47,750
Unix kernel on a PDP7 but in 1969 and this was before that and definitely before Unix was spread around everything was programmed in Fortran pretty much in this toolchain that they were using

158
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:55,120
What's cool is that Russell Cowe, the programmer-student
was also notes in his notes.

159
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,550
This is not in the final paper.

160
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,350
He says, "it was important to find a reliable
random number generator."

161
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,840
How the times have still not changed.

162
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,230
[laughter]

163
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:11,990
The one used was adapted from an algorithm
in communications with the ICM.

164
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,750
A test was carried out to find the frequency
with which each integer from 1 to 100 was

165
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,750
generated and the results considered satisfactory.

166
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:26,660
So we still have the same problems this many
years later.

167
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,050
I like this little note later where he says,
the resultant displace may be plotted on the

168
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,630
Calcomp, but in view of the time required,
photography is more efficient and I thought,

169
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,770
what the hell is the Calcomp?

170
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,990
Well, this is the Calcomp.

171
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,000
What they probably had was a Calcomp 565.

172
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,980
It's a pen plotter.

173
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,670
It was also programmed in Fortran.

174
00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:02,680
I have a little video to show you.

175
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:10,670
So this is an enthusiast on YouTube who I
do not know, who has set up a Calcomp 565.

176
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:24,670
I'm going to jump forward a little bit.

177
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:34,250
So yes, I could see how it would be quite
slow to perhaps output your seashell-generated

178
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,450
designs.

179
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:42,690
Come on, draw the curve!
[laughter]

180
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,860
I'm jumping forward here.

181
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,220
Yay.

182
00:16:50,220 --> 00:17:02,500
So in five minutes, it can plot a sine wave,
which is pretty cool.

183
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,230
[laughter]

184
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,890
So that's kind of neat.

185
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:12,930
You don't have to take pictures of slides
with URLs, because I'll give you a link dump

186
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,770
at the very end that has all of them in it.

187
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,520
I should have told you that at the beginning,
sorry if you're wasting your time.

188
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:27,690
But what's cool is that the Calcomp was also
programmed and has a pretty cool reference

189
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:33,480
documentation, just for programming the Calcomp
so I can imagine this poor student, Russell

190
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,200
Cowe going, oh, my goodness, what have I gotten
myself into for three months to help this

191
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,000
biology professor.

192
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,720
But it seems pretty neat.

193
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,560
But what's cool is there are various little
notes that are separated on different little

194
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,180
pages here.

195
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:59,930
I like this No. 2 bullet point: 25 or 50 arcs,
he describes basically what he's written into

196
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:09,380
his code so even though there isn't any of
the Fortran that survived, you know he definitely

197
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,680
describes exactly what's going on and it's
very, very similar to what's in algorithmic

198
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,030
beauty of seashells later.

199
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:23,690
What I also found interesting is that in the
scanned archival notes, they have similar

200
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,480
outputs, but they're not the ones that were
used in the final paper.

201
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,940
None of the ones in the final paper are in
the notes that I procured.

202
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,920
So they must have done quite a few outputs.

203
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:44,150
Here on the left you see the paper, and on
the right you see a plotted, on the Calcomp,

204
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:51,780
probably took an hour, generated seashell
design that is drawn out with that funky little

205
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,750
plotter, reh-reh!

206
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,670
And next year you see one where they changed
the angles, so these are also different.

207
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:08,300
So I don't know, the original ones have gone
the way of the dinosaur and they're no longer

208
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:14,690
with us.

209
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,200
I'm going to jump a little bit sideways here,
so I kind of -- I went down this huge rabbit

210
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,820
hole with this paper and I was super excited
about it, but what the heck does it have to

211
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,500
do with knitting you're probably wondering.

212
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,460
But it has nothing to do with knitting.

213
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,270
First I'm going to kind of tell you what a
knitting machine is.

214
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:40,140
It's a series of -- knitting itself is a series
of loops that are created from nothing from

215
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:46,810
a raw thread, so a raw yarn, so one single
thread creates that first row of loops and

216
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,240
then the following row gets connected into
that and then the following row gets connected

217
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,240
into the previous row, so the way a knitting
machine does this is that it has a series

218
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,610
of these needles, usually hundreds ever them,
that grab the loop and pull it through the

219
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,090
last loop so you can imagine all lined up.

220
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:13,090
So my machine that I have currently has 699
needles on the front bed in a 50-inch span

221
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:18,750
and they all do this same action.

222
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,040
Because we don't have time for it today and
I know that people like to hear about the

223
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:29,520
history of carding and Jacquard looms that
are not knitting machines, I gave a talk about

224
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,370
that and you can watch that later.

225
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:45,760
So back to this book, this beautiful book,
it's -- I've been obsessed with it for a while,

226
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,830
so when Zeeshan said I could talk about it,
I said yeah, let's do it.

227
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:57,730
The way that it works is that -- how many
of you took partial differential equations?

228
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,840
Heh.

229
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,910
How many of you hated partial differential
equations?

230
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,910
Me too.

231
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:02,910
I really hated it.

232
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:07,140
I have a math degree and I think I'm just
allergic to partial differential equations,

233
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,770
it turns out these seashells are done with
partial differential equations.

234
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:18,270
I'm going to spare I I'm not going to put
any equations up on the slides today, because

235
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:32,510
that's how nice of a mathematician I am and
it works through what I called a how the pigments

236
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,940
are laid down by enzymes along the leading
edge of the seashell and those are affected

237
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,660
by water, they're affected by temperature,
they're affected by the natural phenomenon

238
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:50,840
that are around as to whether or not a pixel
or a piece of the seashell gets pigmented

239
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,000
or not.

240
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,830
And so in the book, they describe this beautifully
so you're welcome to go get your own copy,

241
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,120
because it's a wonderful book.

242
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,310
The book also comes with software.

243
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,050
This particular revision of the book comes
with a floppy disc.

244
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,370
[laughter]

245
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:15,040
Some later revisions come with a CD ROM and
I had a version like that, but I lent it out

246
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,790
and I currently don't have it.

247
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:23,870
Luckily I copied all the software off the
CD ROM, so I'm ahead of the curve.

248
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:30,900
The CD ROM contains basic code in the language
Basic, and

249
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,530
[laughter]

250
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:38,730
Unfortunately it doesn't compile in any modern
or vintage basic compiler that I could find

251
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,600
[laughter]

252
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:49,370
And this was in October of 2012, when I was
primarily so obsessed that I was willing to

253
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:54,560
deal with crying over other people's software.

254
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:02,020
So this is a good five years ago, and all
I was able to use was the built-in executable

255
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:09,510
that was the already chunked binary, and so
that runs a program that looks a lot like

256
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:20,631
this, it has the generative imagery that trickles
down the screen, and then it has the set-up

257
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:27,490
variables, you can kind of turn them on or
off so in this image I can so you what the

258
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:33,361
initiation variables are, so these are the
various -- the various parameters you can

259
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:38,580
change for this particular seashell design
and what's cool about this book is that -- I

260
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:45,270
don't know how many, but over 50 scientifically
named seashells are modeled so it's not just

261
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:53,500
this particular one, which is Cymbiols vespertilio,
or the bat volute, which I had never heard

262
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:00,380
of before.

263
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:07,921
So I had to essentially screenshot this static
image and mux it into something that I could

264
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:13,750
use into my at the time hacked consumer knitting
machine.

265
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:20,330
So this is the first one I knit from stuff
I generated from the book back in 2012, so

266
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,200
it's a two-color piece of knitting.

267
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,040
You can't see this, but the back of this has
stripes, because my hacked consumer knitting

268
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,260
machine had a smart bed and a dumb bed so
one that's microcontroller controlled where

269
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,370
I upgraded the hardware and made it talk to
a modern computer and a fully mechanical double

270
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:44,880
bed that had a set of levers that you could
set to checkerboard or stripe and that's about

271
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
it.

272
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,910
So the back, you can't affect the back whereas
with an industrial machine you can have opposite

273
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,160
colors from the back from the front.

274
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,230
It's just not possible on a packed consumer
knitting machine.

275
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,260
So I was pretty proud of this.

276
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:09,360
This took me seven hours by hand because the
machine is a hand crank, so it's hacked but

277
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
it's not motorized.

278
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
[laughter]

279
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,550
And the last row, so it want bind off, it
can't do the last row so I knit some waste

280
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:23,320
yarn on the end and you hand-stitch finish
the end with what is called a sewn tubular

281
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
bind off.

282
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,830
Any knitters in the house?

283
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:36,700
It's really if I hadly especially at the stitch
density and I made a second one, this is the

284
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:43,360
second one modeled by a friend of mine and
I was really excited about it.

285
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,350
I was ecstatic but it, but I couldn't sell
these as a product or make them for anyone,

286
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:54,770
because they were so time-consuming, so the
machine I had hacked was from 1981, it expected

287
00:25:54,770 --> 00:26:00,400
a floppy drive and it had a maximum pixel
memory space of 200X66 pixels, the needle

288
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:08,370
bed is 200 long so that image got sliced into
7 chunks of 66 pixels or less to be able to

289
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:13,500
fit into the memory size and then I had to
knit them backwards and make sure to load

290
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,200
in the images in the right order.

291
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,570
So part of that was being able to hack the
button matrix on the machine itself and adding

292
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:29,740
basically an Arduino that could control the
-- press the buttons for me to make sure that

293
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:36,520
I loaded things in the right order and this
all came about because of a project that I

294
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:47,420
did with Travis good Speed and aren in Amsterdam
called multi-threaded banjo dinosaur knitting

295
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:56,250
to the extreme which is very Googlable.

296
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:01,010
But if you want to go down this road, so say
you get inspired today and you want your own

297
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:05,770
hacked consumer machine, I don't recommend
going the way I did, because now there are

298
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:12,550
many open source projects that target '80s
consumer knitting machines and the one you

299
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:29,160
should get are evil math science labs A and
a lot and the model you should get is the

300
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,400
KH910.

301
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,140
Don't change the needles until you change
the sponge bar and if you don't know what

302
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,870
that is, that's fine, you can ask me later.

303
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:48,420
So I was super-excited with this, even though
it was super-cloogey and I couldn't even determine

304
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:55,429
how wide the generation was, it was a fixed
pixel width that was baked into that baked

305
00:27:55,429 --> 00:28:03,150
in Basic and I was still super-stoked with
this, because I had outputs, and this was

306
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:08,870
my dream to be able to have generative outputs,
so these are three different generations,

307
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:14,950
even with the same starting row, so the same
initial starting row but different conditions,

308
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:22,360
and a pseudorandom generator baked in means
that you get a different output every time

309
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,320
and you don't get repetition in length so
you could make these as long as you wanted

310
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:33,850
as long as you had endless yarn, you could
just knit forever and it would never repeat

311
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:37,940
and they're' all different but they look similar
and it made me very happy.

312
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:45,400
What else did I want to say about this?

313
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,059
That's it.

314
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,340
So that's what I wanted to say about that.

315
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:58,840
Fast forward to two and a half years ago,
I got one of these.

316
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,880
So I want to specifically thank all of my
Kickstarter backers who stuck with me in the

317
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,970
long haul, because two and a half years is
a really long time.

318
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:11,090
In Kickstarter years it's not a long time,
but it seems like an eternity to me so thank

319
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:24,210
you for cheering me along in this folly of
a pursuit to make one-off generated knitwear.

320
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:32,010
In 2016 I received this, this is in Seattle
which is where I live and will be living because

321
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:37,800
I now have a 2800-pound industrial knitting
machine.

322
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,690
[laughter]

323
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:48,860
This is a CMS530 HP7.2 gauge industrial knitting
machine.

324
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:56,420
It is a 2009 model so it's a used machine
from Stohl, a German company.

325
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:03,340
There are two companies Stohl and Shima Seiki  that have about 90% of the flat industrial knitting market so it was either this one or the other one

326
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,040
I chose correctly

327
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:13,480
I bought it sight unseen and I trained for two months in the south of Germany.

328
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,700
It's in German, because the English class
was full.

329
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:24,700
I was quite motivated. Its been quite the journey.

330
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:29,590
This is what it looks like knitting and sounds
like.

331
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,400
Little snippet.

332
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:39,420
That of course is a rule 110 scarf, so this
has nothing to do with seashells.

333
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,610
How many of you know why rule 110 is important?

334
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,450
Some people.

335
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,960
It's the only rule of the elementary cellular
automata, which is this group of one dimensional cellular automata

336
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,950
That has been proven to be Turing complete

337
00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:04,260
And that was the other paper I was going to
talk about today. Matt Cook's paper on Turing completeness of Rule 110 you should read it

338
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:11,800
It's 40 pages of awesomeness and what's cool
is that he proved that these forms that move

339
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:16,210
across the background when they cross then
you have enough building blocks to build a

340
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:21,540
universal computer. The image itself is complex enough to compute.

341
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:26,500
So you could have a Turing complete scarf or
wrap.

342
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,150
Because why not?

343
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:40,370
Back to the algorithmic beauty of seashells,
the book that we were talking about, the I

344
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:47,170
generated -- I was super into this particular
pattern from Clithon, oualaniense, I can't

345
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,160
pronounce Latin names.

346
00:31:50,160 --> 00:32:00,420
Which is a seashell. So if you can see the pattern on the seashell it looks like sharks teeth but its the pattern on the shell

347
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:05,309
It's hard to explain to people without having
the actual seashell in front of them, so these

348
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:14,460
are some of the generations I did with the
built-in baked-in code. These are from Oct 2012

349
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:22,910
I wasn't able to knit these because there
are three-color images and not 2 color images like the other ones now that I have

350
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:35,860
a three-system industrial knitting machine,
I can knit that.

351
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,480
That is how my office sounds every day.

352
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,660
[laughter]

353
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,350
Much louder, so I usually have headphones
in.

354
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:46,140
If you come visit me, knock loudly on the
door or wave your arms so that I know that

355
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,860
you're there.

356
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,860
I now cohab itate with a 3,000-pound industrial
machine.

357
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,190
I'm a factory of one.

358
00:32:54,190 --> 00:33:03,040
It's just me and the machine, but I'm able
to produce these seashell, generative seashell

359
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,160
knit wear.

360
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,140
These are blankets.

361
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,180
These are two different outputs.

362
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,120
Three different outputs.

363
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:18,560
The back when you have to choose, when you have two colors knitting

364
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,580
Who's hand knitters here?

365
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,700
OK, who knows what double knitting is?

366
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,160
Double knitting is when you have the opposite
colors on the back from the front and you

367
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:34,160
have apparently knit stitches to both sides
so you have a non-curling fabric.

368
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,070
Knitting machines do that really well.

369
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:40,020
It's kind of a fiddly, time-consuming thing
that you follow a chart by hand, it's not

370
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:47,200
my favorite hand knitting, I like doing Estonian
lace and weird things like that but in machine

371
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:55,040
knitting it turns out to be very easy
so you have this reversible non-curling fabric smooth on both

372
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:02,480
sides, it almost comes out of the machine
like that, it comes out with some waste yarns

373
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,620
and some threads I have to sew in but its fully reversible when you have 2 colors and that's a property of knitting.

374
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,659
When you have you move up to three colors
you have to decide what to do on the back

375
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,290
and so this is one of the in-fills.

376
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,359
You can't really tell because it's not super
up close.

377
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:27,040
But its a sort of checkerboard infill of the two colors
so when you have green on the front side,

378
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,830
on the back you have a checker board of
black and white.

379
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:36,260
This is important because I have a three-system
machine, which means it can do three operations

380
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,260
in one pass.

381
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,960
I bet you never thought that knitting machines
were this computationally interesting.

382
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,730
It can do three operations in one pass, so
when you move to four, five, or six colors,

383
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,810
those take the same amount of time as each
other, but they take double the amount of

384
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,130
time as one, two, or three colors.

385
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:58,670
When you're talking about double edged Jacquard,
which is what double knitting is called in

386
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,240
machine-knitting parlance.

387
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:09,160
If you can see there are some problems with
the resolution.

388
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,230
If you get up close here, how up close do
I get?

389
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:21,960
Very up close, you can see here that there's
parts where it looks like it's overly pixelated

390
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,330
where you know, a square of four knit stitches
is one pixel and then there are some spots

391
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:35,370
where it's one pixel to one knit stitch, so
this is a problem where I couldn't get the

392
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:41,240
exact data out of the algorithmic beauty of
seashells, because I'm screenshotting images

393
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,480
that are in a fixed width that is not
pixel-matching to what I'm doing on the knitting

394
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
machine.

395
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,700
So that's the crux of my problem.

396
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:56,060
It took me a little while to get around to
it, but now you understand my problem.

397
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,820
It turns out I'm not alone.

398
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:04,830
I'm not the only one obsessed with seashell
generation in 2017.

399
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,020
I feel much better about it.

400
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,540
Because I was really worried.

401
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:12,170
But it might be a condition that I should
have checked out.

402
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:24,310
Francesco de Comite has published a few papers
on this, because he is interested in 3D printing

403
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,630
seashells that are generated with the patterns
on them.

404
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:35,830
So those are 3D printed with the patterns
generated, and the 3D shape is also generated

405
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:40,590
and it's all 3D print on the 3D printer which
is pretty amazing.

406
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:47,700
What's cool about it is he mentions programming
a sea Shell is not complicated.

407
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:53,300
It requires only some 300 lines of Python
program and I was like what?

408
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,400
What about this baked-in Basic code.

409
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:05,990
It turns out that Francesco has shared some
of his code with me and that is what I'm going

410
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,840
to be working with in the future.

411
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:15,900
So these are all of the links from the talk
from today and you can take a picture of this slide

412
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,440
code because this is not linked but all of
the other links from this talk are linked

413
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,860
including some of the things that I liked
to ...

414
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,040
And this is where you can contact me, which
is pretty much everywhere, and these are snapshots,

415
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,300
Thank you so much!
